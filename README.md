# Virtual-Glasses-try-on-
Virtual try-on systems for glasses have gained significant attention due to their potential to
revolutionize the shopping experience by allowing users to virtually try on different styles of
glasses before making a purchase. This research paper presents a novel approach to building
a virtual glasses try-on system using computer vision and augmented reality techniques. The
system utilizes a webcam to capture the user's face in real-time and applies a segmentation
algorithm to remove the background. A face detection algorithm is then used to locate the
user's face, and virtual glasses frames are overlaid onto the user's image. The system allows
users to try on different styles of glasses and see how they look in real-time. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in providing a realistic and
interactive virtual try-on experience.
